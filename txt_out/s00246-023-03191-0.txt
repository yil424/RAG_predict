RESEARCH Pediatric Cardiology (2023) 44:1293–1301 https://doi.org/10.1007/s00246-023-03191-0 Background Among pediatric cardiac patients, those with single-ventri­ cle physiology (SV) have the highest morbidity and mortal­ ity rates, especially during the first year of life [1–3]. During the interstage period, or the time between the first two stages of single ventricle palliation, these infants have parallel cir­ culation resulting in a fragile balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow and are vulnerable to subtle changes in hemodynamic and respiratory status [2]. Children with SV admitted to the hospital often require unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit after clinical deterioration, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [4, 5]. However, studies have found that some unplanned ICU transfers may be preventable with opportunities to intervene prior to clinical deterioration if at-risk patients were to be detected earlier [6, 7].

Identifying children at risk for deterioration may allow for earlier escalation of care and subsequently decreased mortality. We conducted a retrospective chart review of all admissions to the pediatric cardiology non-ICU service from 2014 to 2018 for children < 18 years old. We defined clinical deterioration as unplanned transfer to the ICU or inpatient mortality. We selected children with SV by diagnosis codes and defined infants as children < 1 year old. We compared demographic, vital sign, and lab values between infants with and without a deterioration event. We evaluated vital sign and medical therapy changes before deterioration events. Among infants with SV (129 deterioration events over 225 admissions, overall 25% with hypoplastic left heart syn­ drome), those who deteriorated were younger (p = 0.001), had lower baseline oxygen saturation (p = 0.022), and higher baseline respiratory rate (p = 0.022), heart rate (p = 0.023), and hematocrit (p = 0.008). Median Duke Pediatric Early Warn­ ing Score increased prior to deterioration (p < 0.001). Deterioration was associated with administration of additional oxy­ gen support (p = 0.012), a fluid bolus (p < 0.001), antibiotics (p < 0.001), vasopressor support (p = 0.009), and red blood cell transfusion (p < 0.001). Infants with SV are at high risk for deterioration. Integrating baseline and dynamic patient data from the electronic health record to identify the highest risk patients may allow for earlier detection and intervention to prevent clinical deterioration.

Pediatric Cardiology (2023) 44:1293–1301 Multiple pediatric early warning scores have been devel­ oped to facilitate earlier detection of clinical signs and symptoms of deterioration in pediatric patients [8]. Detect­ ing impending deterioration in children with SV is espe­ cially difficult due to limitations in technology for patient monitoring and their baseline vital sign abnormalities [9]. The Cardiac Children’s Hospital Early Warning Score (C-CHEWS) was developed and validated at a single cen­ ter to predict cardiac arrest or ICU transfer among inpatient pediatric patients with heart disease [10]. While this score had high sensitivity and specificity (67% and 94% respec­ tively) for identifying those on acute care floors at risk for deterioration, the median lead time for a critical C-CHEWS score was only two hours, which may limit the ability to intervene to prevent deterioration [10]. In this study, we describe a cohort of pediatric cardiol­ ogy patients who experience a clinical deterioration event in a non-ICU hospital environment. Further, we characterize infants with SV by assessing baseline difference between those who deteriorated and those who remained stable as well as by evaluating vital signs and medical therapy changes around a deterioration event. Our goal is to better identify at-risk children to guide resource allocation to opti­ mize care and to reduce in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Methods Study Design and Population We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of pediatric cardiology patients admitted to Duke Children’s Hospital from 2014 to 2018. We included all admissions in which a patient spent time on the non-intensive care inpatient pediatric cardiology service. The study was approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board (Pro00102839). Study Outcomes and Definitions The primary outcome was a clinical deterioration event. We defined deterioration as an unplanned transfer to the intensive care unit or a mortality on the non-intensive care inpatient service. We did not include planned admissions to the intensive care unit from the Emergency Department or the operating room, or transfers from the labor and deliv­ ery or neonatal wards. Patients could have more than one admission during the study period and could have more than one deterioration event per admission. We extracted patient data from the electronic health record (EHR) includ­ ing demographics, vital signs, lab values, orders, and medi­ cation administration information. We defined emergent admission as those who presented through the emergency department. We defined urgent admission as those admitted due to clinical concern, such as following a clinic evalua­ tion on the same day, but did not require emergency room care. We defined admission source based on how a child was initially admitted to the hospital for a given admission. We defined previous location as the service a child was on prior to the pediatric cardiology service. We defined SV based on diagnosis codes (see appendix in Supplemental Materials for full list of diagnosis codes) and confirmed the primary cardiac diagnosis as well ventricular dominance by manual review of echocardiogram reports. We also grouped infants based on surgical intervention: Norwood, PA band, shunt, Glenn, other, or none. Norwood included infants with Norwood repair with either RV-PA conduit or modified Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt. Shunt included infants with surgical systemic to pulmonary shunt or ductal stent for duc­ tal dependent pulmonary blood flow. Glenn included infants with superior cavopulmonary anastomosis such as bidirec­ tional Glenn and Kawashima. We grouped infants with left dominant as well as biventricular dominance together as left dominant [11]. We defined a sub-cohort of infants with SV based on age at admission less than one year. We evaluated baseline vital sign and lab values on pre­ sentation to the inpatient pediatric cardiology service. We recorded baseline vital signs as the mean vital sign values during the first 24 h after presentation to pediatric cardi­ ology. We recorded baseline lab values within 24 h prior to presentation to pediatric cardiology (e.g. if patient trans­ ferred from ICU or emergency department to the inpatient team). If no preceding lab value was obtained, we recorded the first lab value obtained in the first 24 h after presentation to pediatric cardiology. We evaluated vital signs and Duke-Pediatric Early Warn­ ing Score (D-PEWS) over the 48 h preceding each deterio­ ration event. We divided this period into eight consecutive six-hour blocks with the last block ending one hour prior to the deterioration time. For each block, we recorded mean vital signs or D-PEWS score for each patient. D-PEWS is our institutional bedside scoring system that assesses a score across three physiologic domains (behavior, cardio­ vascular, and respiratory) as well as parental and nursing concern (Supplemental Fig. 1), and it is based off the pre­ viously validated C-CHEWS warning score [10]. A higher score suggests more physiologic derangement and a score of three in any single domain or a composite score of four or higher triggers a rapid response evaluation to assess need for escalation of care or transfer to the ICU. The nursing team records a D-PEWS score every four hours for patients on the inpatient pediatric cardiology service. We evaluated changes in therapy associated with each deterioration event. We grouped therapy by medication 1 3 1294

Pediatric Cardiology (2023) 44:1293–1301 class as identified within the electronic health record (anti­ arrhythmic, antibiotic, vasopressor). Fluid boluses included both lactated ringers IV bolus and sodium chloride 0.9% IV bolus. To account for therapies that may have been deliv­ ered in response to clinical changes leading to the deteriora­ tion event, the 24-hour deterioration window included the four hours prior to an event and the 20 h after an event. The 24-hour pre-deterioration window was the preceding 24 h (i.e. starting 28 h prior to an event). We defined therapy use as a binary outcome for each window if any qualifying medication or therapy was given. Data Analysis We performed manual verification on a randomly selected subset of twenty admissions to ensure accurate labeling of deterioration events as well as to verify key data points including patient age, vital signs, and lab values. We used standard summary statistics with counts and percentages for categorical variable and median and interquartile val­ ues (IQR) for continuous variables. We assessed differ­ ences between admissions with and without deterioration events using Chi squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests as the continuous outcomes were not normally distributed. We assessed changes in vital signs and D-PEWS prior to deteri­ oration event using linear mixed models with random inter­ cept and random slope. We used McNemar’s test to assess changes in therapy with deterioration. We considered p values < 0.05 statistically significant. We did not correct for multiple comparisons as this was a hypothesis generating study. We performed all analysis using Python 3.8 (python. org: release date Oct. 14, 2019). Results Overall Patient Characteristics The overall pediatric cardiology cohort included 1612 admissions across 992 children, with deterioration occur­ ring in 288 admissions (18%). Overall, 26 patients died. The median age at admission was 1.6 years (IQR 0.3, 9.6), the median length of stay was 6.2 days (3.4, 14.8), and 418 admissions (26%) involved children with SV. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was the most common single ventricle diagnosis (114 admissions [27%]). Children with a dete­ rioration event were younger on admission (0.6 years [0.1, 5.5] v 2.0 years [0.4, 10.3]; p < 0.001), had longer length of stay (21.6 days [9.9, 61] v 5.2 days [3.2, 10.3]; p < 0.001), and were more likely to have SV (38% v 23%; p < 0.001) (Table 1). They were less likely to be admitted electively (17% v 40%; p < 0.001 across admission types) and less likely to have private insurance (37% v 44%; p = 0.021). Children of any age with SV (relative risk 1.74 [95% CI 1.41–2.15]) and particularly infants with SV (RR 2.15 [1.72–2.68]) had significantly higher risk of deterioration compared to those with two-ventricle circulation. Among this high-risk cohort of infants with SV, there were 227 total admissions across 100 infants with 75 admissions (33%) experiencing 129 total deterioration events. Overall, seven infants with SV died. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) was the most common primary cardiac diagnosis (57 admissions [25%]). Deterioration was relatively more common for infants following Norwood repair (39% v 14%) and less common following Glenn (8% v 22%) or PA band (8% v 17%) (p = 0.001 across surgical repair types). Infants with SV who deteriorated were younger at the time of hos­ pital admission (0.0 years [0.0, 0.4] v 0.4 years [0.0, 0.7]; p < 0.001), had longer length of stay (60.8 days [26.1, 117.9] v 7.9 days [3.9, 19.9]; p < 0.001), and were less likely to be admitted electively (11% v 32%; p < 0.001 across admis­ sion types) compared to infants with SV who did not dete­ riorate (Table 2). Infants most commonly transferred to the pediatric cardiology service from the ICU (49% of infants). No difference in rate of deterioration was seen based on previous location prior to the pediatric cardiology service (p = 0.36). HLHS was more common (32% v 22%) and tricuspid atresia was less common (8% v 18%) for infants with a dete­ rioration event, but this association was not significant when evaluated across all cardiac diagnoses (p = 0.08). There was no significant association with ventricular dominance (p = 0.43). Infants with SV Baseline Characteristics Upon presentation to the inpatient pediatric cardiology ser­ vice, infants with SV who deteriorated had younger age (median 0.2 years [0.1, 0.4] v 0.4 years [0.1, 0.7]; p = 0.001), lower baseline oxygen saturation (80% [78%, 88%] v 83% [79%, 91%]; p = 0.022), and higher baseline respiration rate (46 breaths per minute [39, 52] v 43 [37, 49]; p = 0.022), heart rate (141 beats per minute [129, 151] v 135 [125, 146]; p = 0.023) and hematocrit (43.4 [40.6, 47.6] v 40.3 [37.0, 45.7]; p = 0.008) (Table 3). No difference was seen in baseline systolic blood pressure (p = 0.12), white blood cell count (p = 0.10), sodium (p = 0.53), or creatinine (p = 0.46). Characteristics Around Deterioration Infants with SV experienced 129 deterioration events. Dete­ rioration occurred a median of 8.0 days (2.0, 23.1) after presentation to the pediatric cardiology service (Table 4). 1 3 1295

No significant difference was seen in the use of antiarrhythmic therapy (16 infants v 14 infants, p = 0.62). Discussion In this study, we describe deterioration events in pediatric cardiology patients, who are at high risk for clinical dete­ rioration, with an event occurring in 18% of admissions. Infants with SV represent an even higher risk population, with deterioration occurring in one-third of admissions. Our Twelve patients deteriorated within 24  h of presentation. While there were no significant or consistent changes across individual vital signs during the 48 h prior to a deteriora­ tion event – including respiration rate (p = 0.31), heart rate (p = 0.98), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.94), or oxygen satu­ ration (p = 0.55) – there was a significant increase in com­ posite D-PEWS scores (median 1.0 [1.0, 2.0] 12 h before event v 2.0 [1.0, 2.5] 6 h before; p < 0.001). We evaluated the therapy infants with SV received with deterioration compared to the preceding 24 h (Table 5). Sev­ enty-nine infants (61%) previously receiving oxygen sup­ port received an increase in oxygen support and 23 infants (18%) were newly started on supplemental oxygen. Deterio­ ration was associated with an increase in the overall number of infants receiving any supplemental oxygen (98 infants with deterioration v 83 infants in preceding 24 h; p = 0.012), Table 1  Characteristics of all pediatric cardiology patients.

Pediatric Cardiology (2023) 44:1293–1301 did not see a significant change in any single vital sign prior to event, suggesting a composite warning score has higher sensitivity for detecting a deterioration event. However, our data also highlight the limitations of the current warning sys­ tem. The D-PEWS score increase was predominately in the final six-hour window before a deterioration event, which is similar to prior assessment of the C-CHEWS warning score analysis suggests that there are baseline differences between infants with SV who deteriorate and those who do not. There were also significant changes in respiratory support and medication administrations with deterioration. Our data demonstrated a significant increase in our insti­ tutional warning score, D-PEWS, prior to a deterioration event. Notably when averaged across all infants with SV, we Table 2  Characteristics of all infants with single ventricle physiology. Data presented as median (interquartile values) and count (percentage).

Pediatric Cardiology (2023) 44:1293–1301 studies had not identified respiration rate as a significant predictor. This discrepancy is possibly due to the difference in patient population, as prior studies analyzed children admitted to the intensive care unit, who likely have different baseline physiology. Optimizing clinical deterioration detection systems will require integrating both vital sign and lab value data as well as additional information from the EHR such as changes in medication or respiratory support. Accordingly, event detection models that incorporate a child’s underlying car­ diac physiology as well as vital sign parameters may have increased performance [15]. Combining EHR derived data with machine learning methods has shown early promise for improved event detection in the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit [16–18]. Further work will be required to develop more sophisticated clinical deterioration models for children and infants on non-ICU services, which likely have distinct arrays of available patient information. Automatic extrac­ tion of data from the EHR may also help lessen the work­ load on bedside nurses required by manual scoring-based warning systems. It will be critical to identify the highest risk infants, especially as care bundles targeting high-risk patients have reduced the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest [19]. Our data indicated deterioration was relatively more common in patients with Medicaid or Medicare insurance, suggesting a difference in outcomes based on the socioeco­ nomic status of patients’ families. This finding is similar to previous studies that have linked race, socioeconomic fac­ tors, and insurance type with divergent outcomes [20–22]. This disparity could potentially be due to differences in out­ patient care prior to admission, in initial triage, or in care provided during hospitalization. Additionally, a recent study suggests that maternal metabolic syndrome and maternal placental syndrome may be significant prenatal contributors to disparities in outcomes for children with congenital heart disease [23]. We did not identify a difference in outcomes by payor type among the small cohort of infants with SV, that demonstrated that a critically elevated score occurred a median of only two hours before an event [10]. This short time horizon may limit the efficacy of interventions to pre­ vent deterioration from occurring. Additionally, the median score was increased to only 2.0. In our scoring system, a composite D-PEWS score must be at least 4 to trigger eval­ uation from a rapid response team. Thus, most infants with SV would not be detected before deterioration events, sug­ gesting that a more robust risk assessment tool to allow for earlier identification of at-risk patients is needed. Our data also help to describe the etiology of deteriora­ tion in infants with SV. Desaturation is a major cause of deterioration with 18% of events requiring new respiratory support and 61% of events requiring an increase in respi­ ratory support. A recent study of children with congenital heart disease in Japan similarly identified desaturation as the most common cause for rapid response team evalua­ tion [12]. This likely reflects the delicate balance between systemic and pulmonary blood flow in the parallel circu­ lation of infants with SV physiology [13]. Acute arrhyth­ mia was uncommon in our cohort, as we did not identify a significant increase in antiarrhythmic usage. It is possible that infants who already required one antiarrhythmic medi­ cation acutely required addition of a second therapy, such as addition of a second agent for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, which would not be captured in our analysis. Additionally, only a small subset (9%) of infants with SV required initiation of vasopressor therapy suggesting that acute low cardiac output was uncommon once patients were on the non-ICU team. Our study identified small but statistically significant baseline differences in oxygen saturation, respiration rate, heart rate, and hematocrit between infants with SV who deteriorated and those who did not. Previous studies evalu­ ated precursors for cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intuba­ tion for interstage infants with SV in the cardiac intensive care unit and similarly found lower oxygen saturation and higher heart rates to be risk factors [9, 14]. These previous Table 3  Baseline vital signs and lab values of infants with single ventricle physiology (SV infants) on presentation to the non-intensive care pediat­ ric cardiology service grouped by those who did and did not have a subsequent deterioration event.

Pediatric Cardiology (2023) 44:1293–1301 possibly because more hospital resources are provided to these infants through a single ventricle monitoring program [24]. Further research is essential to ensure all children receive equitable care and outcomes regardless of socioeco­ nomic or racial background. We recognize limitations in our study. While we selected infants based on SV physiology with grouping by primary cardiac diagnosis, we acknowledge these are not homog­ enous groups. We did not incorporate additional anatomic or functional information, such as degree of AV valve regur­ gitation, systemic ventricle systolic function, or type of pul­ monary blood source, which have been shown to contribute to patient morbidity and mortality [25, 26]. Incorporating these parameters would likely allow for detection of further difference between groups and would strengthen a clinical deterioration detection system. Additionally, our definition of clinical deterioration is based on patient transfer records. While we evaluated changes in therapy around deteriora­ tion, we were unable to determine the exact cause for acute deterioration for each patient. As a result, there may be addi­ tional clinical changes we were unable to recognize. Finally, as a single center study, our results may not be applicable for all pediatric medical centers. Other institutions may have different thresholds for transferring a patient to the ICU or different baseline levels of acuity on non-ICU pediatric cardiology teams, which could affect the characteristics of those patients who deteriorate [27, 28]. Conclusion Infants with SV are at high risk for clinical deterioration. There are baseline differences in admission characteris­ tics, vital signs, and lab values between infants with SV who have a deterioration and event and those who remain stable. Additionally, there are significant changes in oxygen support and medical therapy associated with deterioration events. Integrating baseline and dynamic patient data from the Electronic Health Record to identify the highest risk patients may allow for earlier detection and intervention and prevent clinical deterioration.
