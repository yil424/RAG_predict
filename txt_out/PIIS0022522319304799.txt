Early prediction of critical events for infants with single-ventricle physiology in critical care using routinely collected data Victor M. Ruiz, MS,a,b Lucas Saenz, MD,c Alejandro Lopez-Magallon, MD,d Ashlee Shields, RN, MSN, CCRN,c Henry A. Ogoe, PhD,e Srinivasan Suresh, MD,e Ricardo Munoz, MD,d and Fuchiang R. Tsui, PhDa,b,f,g ABSTRACT Objective: Critical events are common and difﬁcult to predict among infants with congenital heart disease and are associated with mortality and long-term sequelae. We aimed to achieve early prediction of critical events, that is, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, emergency endotracheal intubation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in infants with single-ventricle physiology before second-stage surgery. We hypothesized that na€ıve Bayesian models learned from expert knowledge and clinical data can predict critical events early and accurately. Methods: We collected 93 patients with single-ventricle physiology admitted to intensive care units in a single tertiary pediatric hospital between 2014 and 2017. Using knowledge elicited from experienced cardiac-intensive-care-unit providers and machine-learning techniques, we developed and evaluated the Cardiacintensive-care Warning INdex (C-WIN) system, consisting of a set of na€ıve Bayesian models that leverage routinely collected data. We evaluated predictive performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. We performed the evaluation at 5 different prediction horizons: 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours before the onset of critical events. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the C-WIN models ranged between 0.73 and 0.88 at different prediction horizons. At 1 hour before critical events, C-WIN was able to detect events with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% conﬁdence interval, 0.840.92) and a sensitivity of 84% at the 81% speciﬁcity level. Conclusions: Predictive models may enhance clinicians’ ability to identify infants with single-ventricle physiology at high risk of critical events. Early prediction of critical events may indicate the need to perform timely interventions, potentially reducing morbidity, mortality, and health care costs.

Central Message C-WIN models achieved early prediction of critical events in infants with single-ventricle physiology by leveraging routinely collected data, artiﬁcial intelligence, and expert clinical knowledge. Perspective Infants with SV physiology are at high risk of unexpected deterioration before stage 2 palliation. We developed the C-WIN system using routinely collected clinical data, machine learning, and clinical knowledge. C-WIN predicted critical events with up to 8 hours of anticipation and may help clinicians perform early interventions to reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. See Commentaries on pages 244 and 246. Children and adults with congenital heart disease are a diverse and complex population whose management presents a challenge for clinicians and a heavy burden for health care systems. In the United States, 3.7% of pediatric hospitalizations and 15% of the total cost of pediatric hospitalizations are related to congenital heart disease.1 From the aDepartment of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, and Tsui Laboratory, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa; bDepartment of Biomedical Informatics, and gDepartment of Bioengineering, and fIntelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa; cDepartment of Critical Care Medicine and eDivision of Health Informatics, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pa; and dDivision of Cardiac Critical Care Medicine, Children’s National Medical Center, Washington, DC.

Infants with single-ventricle (SV) physiology are among the most complex congenital heart disease subpopulations and have high mortality and morbidity risk before stage 2 surgical repair.1 Although in-hospital mortality has decreased,2-4 patient deterioration may happen unexpectedly during the course of critical care. Even under the care of experienced critical-care teams, potentially catastrophic critical events (CEs), such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), emergency endotracheal intubation (EEI), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are common in patients with SV physiology. Such events may negatively affect morbidity, mortality, and hospital length of stay.5,6 Early warning systems are clinical decision support aids that can help clinicians detect patient deterioration by assessing patients’ risk of CEs in real time and providing alerts. To be effective, these systems should provide accurate and meaningful alerts without contributing to increased clinician workload or alert fatigue.7,8 Models that predict mortality risk in general intensive care unit (ICU) populations have been available for decades.9,10 However, models that predict CEs in specialized populations such as infants with SV physiology are scarce. Although several early warning systems for CEs have been validated in non-ICU11-13 and ICU14-18 populations, only a few have been validated in our target population.19-21 To the best of our knowledge, Rusin and colleagues21 published the only model for infants with SV physiology in the ICU that can predict CEs in realtime. This model exhibited high accuracy in the hour preceding CEs. Nonetheless, this state-of-the-art model has limitations. First, its accuracy decreases rapidly when CEs are predicted more than 2 hours in advance. Second, it relies on real-time analysis of electrocardiogram waveforms sampled at 240 Hz and vital signs sampled at 0.5 Hz, which may present technologic and ﬁnancial challenges for many institutions. To address the need of an early warning system for the SV ICU population, we developed the Cardiac-intensivecare Warning INdex (C-WIN) system. C-WIN is composed of predictive models that leverage routinely collected data for the prediction of CEs (CPR, EEI, and ECMO) in infants with SV physiology in pediatric ICUs, including pediatric ICU, neonatal ICU, and cardiac ICU. We built these models through the elicitation of clinical knowledge from clinical experts and the application of machine-learning techniques. We hypothesized that C-WIN can accurately predict the onset of CEs from routinely collected data with several hours of anticipation and that machine-learning techniques can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of expert-based models. The contributions of this study are 2-fold. First, we developed models that incorporated expert knowledge and applied machine-learning techniques to achieve stateof-the-art early prediction of CEs. Second, we analyzed how the predictive performance of our models changed on the basis of the lead time before CEs used to select data for model training. MATERIALS AND METHODS In this section, we describe the target cohort, deﬁnition of cases and controls, data processing, model development, and performance evaluation. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Pittsburgh approved this study (PRO17020157). Data Collection We retrieved inpatient data of infants admitted to the ICUs (pediatric ICU, neonatal ICU, and cardiac ICU) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. We included hospital admissions of infants less than 6 months old who had SV diagnoses and were admitted to ICUs between January 2014 and August 2017. We excluded hospital admissions of patients who had undergone second surgical palliation (bidirectional Glenn). Figure 1 describes the data retrieval process, and Table E1 in the Supplemental Material lists the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases codes used to identify those with SV physiology. Case Deﬁnition We deﬁned cases as CEs that occurred in the ICU before patients underwent stage 2 surgery and at least 8 hours after patients’ ﬁrst ICU admission during a hospital admission. We considered multiple CEs from the same patient as independent cases if they occurred at least 8 hours after previous CEs. This allowed us to compare predictive performance at different prediction horizons (time before CEs) on the same cases with up to 8 hours of anticipation. We used documented times of clinical events available in the Cerner electronic health record (EHR) system at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh as the gold standard to identify the start and end times of CEs.

in nursing and respiratory therapy charts, and the end time (extubation) was the time when airway changes from artiﬁcial to natural were documented by a respiratory therapist. For ECMO, start and end times were the times of cannulation and decannulation, respectively, which were documented by perfusionists in charge of managing ECMO circuits. For CPR, start times were the time when speciﬁc keywords were documented in nursing communication notes. Keywords included arrest, arrest sheet, arrest code, chest compressions, condition A, and CPR. Control Deﬁnition We deﬁned controls as periods of ICU stays longer than 24 hours from patients who did not experience CEs during their hospital admission. We divided ICU stays into 24-hour windows and used each window as a distinct control. Figure 1 describes the case-control deﬁnition process. Expert Model Development We built expert-based models using knowledge elicited from expert clinicians (1 pediatric critical-care cardiologist and 1 pediatric cardiologist, assisted by 2 cardiac ICU nurse specialists). Expert knowledge included a list of 34 routinely collected clinical variables that experts identiﬁed as relevant for predicting CEs, meaningful numeric ranges for each variable, and contingency tables that quantiﬁed experts’ assessment of the importance of each variable. We mapped expert contingency tables to discrete conditional probability tables (CPTs), which denote the extent to which observing a variable value inﬂuences the probability of experiencing CEs according to expert opinion. Variables included vital signs and laboratory-test results (a full list is available in Table E2 in the Supplemental Material). Experts also identiﬁed a subset of 16 variables considered the minimal set of relevant variables. We used expert CPTs to parametrize na€ıve Bayes (NB) network models. These models assume that predictors are conditionally independent given the value of the outcome variable (CEs) as indicated by the following equation: PðX1; X2; .; XnjCEÞ ¼ Y n i¼1 PðXijCEÞ where Xi is a predictor (eg, blood pressure [BP]) and CE is the outcome variable. Bayes’ theorem is used to compute the posterior probability of CEs given observed predictor values, as shown in the following equation: PðCEjX1; X2; .; XnÞ ¼ Qn i¼1PðXijCEÞPðCEÞ Qn i¼1PðXijCEÞPðCEÞþQn i¼1P  XijCE  P  CE  where Xi is the i-th predictor, n is the number of predictors, and PðCEÞ ¼ 1  PðCEÞ. We built 4 NB models based exclusively on elicited knowledge (2 from each expert). The NB-expert1-full and NB-expert2-full models used all 34 available variables, and the NB-expert1-lean and NB-expert2-lean models CHP hospital admissions: With SV diagnosis, with ICU (CICU, PICU, NICU) stays, of age less than 6 months, before stage-2 surgical repair, and between Jan 1, 2014 - Aug 30, 2017 Identified all critical events (CEs) before stage 2 surgery (146 admissions) (261 CEs) Identified eligible CEs: • In the ICU, and • At least 8 hours from patients’ first ICU admissions or previous CEs Non-eligible (130 CEs) Exclude Cases (n = 131) Controls (n = 131) Divided ICU stays into 24-hour windows Identified ICU stay longer than 24 hours Identified all ICU stays before stage 2 surgery (59 ICU stays) (33 ICU stays) Randomly selected <24 Hrs (26 ICU stays) Without CEs (37 admissions) FIGURE 1. Data retrieval and case-control deﬁnition process; multiple CEs during the same hospital admission were considered as different cases and were eligible if they occurred at least 8 hours after patients’ ﬁrst ICU admission or a previous CE. ICU stays from patients who did not experience CEs during their hospital admission and were longer than 24 hours were selected as controls. Control ICU stays were divided into 24-hour windows, and all windows were considered as separate controls. We randomly selected 131 control windows to match the number of CE cases.

used the minimal subset of 16 variables. Each expert deﬁned his/her own variable ranges and CPTs. Machine-Learning Model Development We used clinical data to build additional NB models that combined expert knowledge and machine-learning techniques. These models, identiﬁed by the NB-ML preﬁx, differed from NB-expert models in 2 ways. First, they used all 34 variables (NB-ML-full models) or a subset of variables selected based on information gain scores22 (NB-ML-lean models) with an empirical threshold of 0.01. Information gain ranges between 0 and 1, denoting no prediction ability or perfect prediction, respectively. Second, NB-ML models’ CPTs were computed with maximumlikelihood estimates obtained from clinical data. We estimated CPTs from variable values (patient states) at different prediction horizons. Thus, CPTs estimated from patient states at 8 hours before CEs may differ substantially from those estimated from patient states at 2 hours before CEs. We built NB-ML models using patient states at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours before CEs, as described in the Graphical Abstract (available online). For example, the NB-ML-lean-2 model was built with variables selected using information gain scores and CPTs estimated from patient states at 2 hours before CEs. We expected models built based on patient states at a given prediction horizon to achieve the best performance when predicting CEs with the same lead time. Finally, we built 2 ensemble models (NB-ML-avg-full and NB-ML-avg-lean) whose predictions were the average of the predictions from either all NB-ML-full or all NB-ML-lean models. Data Processing We processed longitudinal values of each variable in 3 steps: variablevalue priority selection, uniform-window resampling, and missing-value imputation as described next. TABLE 1.

Variable-Value Priority Selection Model variables can be coded with different clinical concepts in an EHR system. For example, diastolic BP may be represented by arterial diastolic pressure (invasive measurement) and diastolic BP (noninvasive). For each variable, we identiﬁed all relevant EHR clinical concepts and aggregated their measurements into a single series of values in chronologic order. We deﬁned priority rules to select variablevalues when multiple clinical concepts were available simultaneously (eg, choose invasive over noninvasive BP values if both are available). Table E2 in the Supplemental Material shows the clinical concepts associated to each variable and their priority levels. Uniform-Window Variable Resampling We resampled variable values every 30 minutes, ending at the time of CEs for cases and at the time of discharge for controls. We averaged values of the same variable available during the same 30-minute window. Missing Value Imputation Although some variables (eg, BP, heart rate) are measured hourly, others (eg, lactate, base excess) may be measured at irregular intervals of several hours. Moreover, some variables (eg, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs, also known as ‘‘ADAMTS 13 activity’’) are measured rarely, leading to missing data. We imputed missing values with previous observations within 6 hours or with the variable’s mean value in the training dataset if no previous measurements were available. Prediction Performance Evaluation We evaluated predictive performance in 10-fold cross-validation23 with 3 metrics, namely, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and speciﬁcity. AUC values of 0.5 and 1 denote no predictive ability and perfect prediction, respectively. We evaluated each model at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours before the onset of CEs, thus assessing whether performance deteriorated as we predicted CEs further into the future. We used 2-sided DeLong tests24 with Bonferroni multiple-hypotheses correction25 to compare AUCs. We used 2 criteria to select the values used to generate predictions (posterior probabilities of CEs). For cases, we selected variable values known during the 30-minute window ending at the time of presentation of CEs. For controls, we selected variable values from the mid-point (12th hour) of each 24-hour control period. Secondary Analyses We tested whether assumptions in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of CEs affected model performance. First, we relaxed the CE inclusion criteria by including CEs that occurred at least 2 hours (instead of 8 hours) after ﬁrst ICU admission or previous CEs and measured the performance of the NB-ML-full-2 model. Second, we applied a stricter CE inclusion criteria and measured the performance of the NB-ML-avg-model keeping only 1 CE per hospital admission in the test dataset. We made no changes to the models or to the set of controls in the test dataset for these analyses. RESULTS Cohort Description We identiﬁed 146 hospital admissions in the study period. These corresponded to 120 patients, 223 ICU stays, and 261 CEs. A total of 93 patients and 131 CEs met our inclusion criteria for analysis, including 118 EEI, 9 ECMO, and 4 CPR events. Six of the included EEIs preceded further patient deterioration. Speciﬁcally, 5 preceded ECMO (3, 11, 21, 652, and 929 hours after intubation) and 1 preceded CPR (30 minutes after intubation). We randomly selected 131 control periods to match the number of cases. Although most patients had only 1 eligible CE during their ICU stays, some patients experienced up to 8. Figure 2 shows the distribution of eligible CEs per patient and the number of eligible CEs depending on the amount of available data. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome was the most common primary diagnosis (43% of study population) followed by TABLE 2.

mitral stenosis (19.4%), as shown in Table 1. Norwood was the most common palliative procedure (29% of study population) followed by Blalock–Taussig shunt (16.1%), as shown in Table 2. The majority (37.4%) of included CEs occurred 7 or more days after patients underwent palliative procedures. Figure 3 shows the distribution of times when CEs occurred relative to palliative procedures. In our secondary analyses, we identiﬁed 154 CEs that happened at least 2 hours after ﬁrst ICU admission or previous CEs. Additional CEs not included in the primary analysis included 21 EEI events, 1 ECMO event, and 1 CPR event. Prediction Performance Table 3 shows the AUC of all of our 16 models for all prediction horizons. Among purely expert-based models, the NB-expert1-full model achieved the best performance with AUCs ranging from 0.49 to 0.71. Models that combined expert knowledge and machine-learning techniques (NB-ML-full models) achieved statistically signiﬁcantly higher AUCs compared with expert models for every prediction horizon (Bonferroni-adjusted P < .01). They achieved AUCs of 0.88 (NB-ML-full-1 model) and 0.73 (NB-ML-full-8 model) 1 and 8 hours before CEs, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that at 1 hour before CEs, the NB-ML-full-1 model had a sensitivity of 84% at the 81% speciﬁcity level and a sensitivity of 49% at the 95% speciﬁcity level. At 8 hours before CEs, the NB-ML-full-8 model had a sensitivity of 57% at the 80% speciﬁcity level or a sensitivity of 25% at the 95% speciﬁcity level. The ensemble model with feature selection (NB-MLavg-lean) achieved similar performance to that of the full ensemble model and reduced the variable space from 34 to 24.

hematocrit, lactate, and creatinine had the highest information gain scores at 1 hour before CEs. The AUC of our predictive models increased as the prediction horizon approached the time of CEs. Figure 4 shows how the NB-expert1-full, NB-ML-avg-full, and every NBML-full model performed at each prediction horizon. We observed that the NB-ML-avg-full model’s performance deteriorated less over time compared with all other NBML-full models. The NB-ML-avg-full and NB-ML-lean ensemble models predicted CEs by averaging the predictions produced by all NB-ML-full or NB-ML-lean models, respectively. Figure 5 shows the receiver operating characteristics curves of the NB-ML-avg-full model at every prediction horizon and sensitivity and speciﬁcity values for possible prediction thresholds. In our secondary analyses, the NB-ML-full-2 had an AUC of 0.84 (0.79-0.89) at 2 hours before CEs after adding CEs that happened between 2 and 8 hours before ﬁrst ICU admission or previous CEs to the test dataset. Finally, when evaluated on a test set with 1 CE per hospital admission (74 EEIs, 4 ECMOs, and 3 CPRs), the NB-ML-avg-full model had AUCs of 0.88 (0.82-0.94) and 0.76 (0.67-0.83) at 1 and 8 hours before CEs, respectively. DISCUSSION Hospital care of infants with SV physiology is complex because of their unique physiology, elevated severity of illness, and unpredictable clinical deterioration. In this study, we developed the C-WIN models, which achieved early prediction of CEs in this population. We addressed this need by developing predictive models that use objective and routinely collected data that can be retrieved automatically from an EHR system. Rather than following a completely data-driven approach, we incorporated expert knowledge into our models, which we believe is important to facilitate the adoption of predictive models into clinical workﬂows (Video 1). We tested the hypothesis that models built from expert knowledge could predict CEs. We found that expert models achieved modest performance from 1 to 4 hours before CEs. However, they lost predictive power after 6 hours before CEs. A possible explanation for this behavior is that the CPTs provided by clinicians reﬂect the characteristics of patients close to the time of decompensation. We also tested the hypothesis that applying machinelearning techniques could increase performance signiﬁcantly. We found that computing CPTs from retrieved training data resulted in statistically signiﬁcantly higher performance compared with using expert-deﬁned CPTs. Furthermore, using information gain reduced model complexity. With a conservative selection threshold, the NB-ML-lean models achieved similar performance than that of NB-ML-full models using fewer variables. Although NB networks are relatively simple compared with other modeling strategies (eg, deep artiﬁcial neural networks, support vector machines), we believe that they are an appropriate choice for this work. They have been used in biomedical research since the 1960s and are well suited for clinical applications.26,27 Their computation is efﬁcient, they can operate with missing and categoric data explicitly, and they can incorporate prior knowledge from clinicians or clinical data.

The models used 34 variables identiﬁed by pediatric cardiologists as relevant for the prediction of CEs. They have NB structure and differ in the method used to compute their conditional probability tables (CPTs). The NB-Expert1 model was built exclusively from expert knowledge. Alternatively, the NB-ML-full models used CPTs derived from clinical data at different times before the onset of CEs, as denoted by their numeric sufﬁx (eg, the NB-ML-full-2 model used patient states 2 hours before CEs). The NB-ML-avg-full model is an ensemble classiﬁer whose predictions are the mean value of predictions from all NB-ML-full models.

structure and small number of parameters are beneﬁcial in the absence of a large training dataset, for example, those with SV physiology. We analyzed the relationship between the time before CEs of patient states used to train machine-learning models and their performance at different prediction horizons, as shown in Figure 4. Models trained with data close to the time of CEs performed best at prediction of imminent deterioration, whereas models trained with data further from the time of CEs performed best in early prediction. For use in a clinical setting where having 1 single model may be a practical necessity, we found that the ensemble strategy produced a model with a reasonable balance between imminent and early prediction performance. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in early warning systems and a variety of predictive models being used in clinical settings. These models are often validated in the adult population, and there have been efforts to adapt them to pediatric patients. However, the performance of generic early warning systems has suffered in certain populations in whom speciﬁc scores are better suited.13,28,29 To the best of our knowledge, the model by Rusin and colleagues21 is the only model available for real-time prediction of CEs in infants with SV. Although this model achieved higher prediction performance than our best model in the hour preceding CEs, clinicians may be aware of patient deterioration at that time. In comparison, our best model performed better at early prediction of CEs, 1.00 1.00 0.75 0.75 0.50 0.50 False Positive Rate (1-Specificity) True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) 0.25 0.25 0.00 0.00 Prediction horizon 1 Hour.

Receiver operating characteristics of the NB-ML-avg-full model. This model predicted critical events (CEs) by averaging the predictions of all NB-ML-full models, which were built based on 34 clinical variables identiﬁed by pediatric cardiologists as relevant for the prediction of CEs. The conditional probability tables (CPTs) of variables in NB-ML-full models were computed on the basis of maximum-likelihood estimates obtained from clinical data at different times before the onset of CEs.

achieving moderate performance up to 8 hours before CEs. We achieved this using variables that are routinely available in most hospital EHR systems. Therefore, our models could be more feasibly implemented in institutions that do not have the technologic or ﬁnancial resources required to collect and analyze data such as electrocardiogram waveforms in real time. Finally, we retrieved data from a larger cohort to develop our models, including 93 patients and 131 CEs. Early, real-time prediction of CEs may help clinicians reduce morbidity, mortality, length of stay, health care costs, and the suffering of patients and guardians. However, to fully realize the beneﬁts of implementing such systems in clinical practice, they should be speciﬁc enough to minimize alert fatigue and should not increase the burden of clinicians or divert resources from other aspects of care. From a clinical standpoint, our models may enable early interventions and avoidance of up to 49% of CEs with a speciﬁcity of 95% (based on performance 1 hour before CEs). This would allow clinicians to focus on patients truly at risk of CEs while minimizing alert fatigue. Furthermore, because our models use physiologic variables that may be extracted automatically from the EHR, an early warning system based on our models may operate autonomously and at low operational cost without disrupting clinicians’ workﬂow. We envision a potential implementation of our models as an alert-triggering system with a 2-tiered set of responses. First, a model calibrated for increased sensitivity and earliest response may be monitored via virtual surveillance in a Tele-ICU setting, following a well-established model in adult patients.30 Then, a second model calibrated for high speciﬁcity may be used to prompt a rapid response from bedside clinicians. Study Limitations Our study had several limitations. First, all admissions came from a single institution (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh). Although this center is one of the major tertiary referral hospitals serving Western Pennsylvania and neighboring states (12,333 inpatient visits in 2017), our results may not be generalizable to different populations. Second, we could not retrospectively retrieve some variables that experts believed to be relevant, including electrocardiography, echocardiography, and x-ray imaging. However, those additional data may not be readily available in many hospitals and EHR systems. Nevertheless, it may be feasible to develop a more comprehensive model that leverages both routinely collected and high-frequency electrocardiogram data in the future. Thus, the same model may be applied in hospitals with varying levels of technologic resources. Third, we imputed missing values with data available within a 6-hour period. Although this may be a reasonable assumption, some variables may change rapidly, and more elaborate imputation techniques may improve performance. Fourth, our test set included a limited number of ECMO and CPR events, and we were not able to ascertain the performance of our models for these events separately. Fifth, our models did not leverage longitudinal changes in variables values, with the exception of changes in creatinine and mixed venous saturation. This will be an area for improvement in future iterations of our models. Likewise, we did not include variables related to clinical interventions. Although it is true that some interventions may signal imminent deterioration (eg, order of ADAMTS13 activity test), for the ﬁrst iteration of our models we decided to focus exclusively on physiologic variables. Finally, event times and variable values collected from EHRs were often entered manually as part of routine care and may have been subject to potential data-entry errors. CONCLUSIONS We developed and validated predictive models that achieved early prediction of CEs in infants with SV physiology. These models used routinely collected data commonly available in hospital EHR systems. Thus, our models potentially can be deployed to most pediatric hospitals and help ICU teams to predict patient deterioration with up to 8 hours of anticipation. Early prediction of CEs may help clinicians perform interventions aimed at reducing morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and health care costs associated with such events.
