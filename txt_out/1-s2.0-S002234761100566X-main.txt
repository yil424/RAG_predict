Pemberton, RNC, MS, Jennifer Russell, MD, Mario Stylianou, PhD, and Daphne Hsu, MD, on behalf of the Pediatric Heart Network Investigators* Objectives To describe growth patterns in infants with single ventricle physiology and determine factors inﬂuencing growth. Study design Data from 230 subjects enrolled in the Pediatric Heart Network Infant Single Ventricle Enalapril Trial were used to assess factors inﬂuencing change in weight-for-age z-score (z) from study enrollment (0.7  0.4 months) to pre-superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC; 5.1  1.8 months, period 1) and pre-SCPC to ﬁnal study visit (14.1  0.9 months, period 2). Predictor variables included patient characteristics, feeding regimen, clinical center, and medical factors during neonatal (period 1) and SCPC hospitalizations (period 2). Univariate regression analysis was performed, followed by backward stepwise regression and bootstrapping reliability to inform a ﬁnal multivariable model. Results Weights were available for 197 of 230 subjects for period 1 and 173 of 197 subjects for period 2. For period 1, greater gestational age, younger age at study enrollment, tube feeding at neonatal hospitalization discharge, and clinical center were associated with a greater negative z (poorer growth) in multivariable modeling (adjusted R2 = 0.39, P < .001). For period 2, younger age at SCPC and greater daily caloric intake were associated with greater positive z (better growth; R2 = 0.10, P = .002). Conclusions Aggressive nutritional support and earlier SCPC are modiﬁable factors associated with a favorable change in weight-for-age z-score. (J Pediatr 2011;159:1017-22). G rowth impairment in infants with congenital heart disease is well documented, particularly in cyanotic forms of congenital heart disease including single ventricle physiology.1-4 Infants with cyanotic heart lesions are ‘‘stunted,’’ with both weight and height below reference range.3 Poor growth is an important problem in infants with single ventricle (ISV) physiology,5-9 particularly before performance of the superior cavopulmonary connection (SCPC). Growth impairment during early infancy is associated with adverse developmental outcome and increased surgical risk in this population requiring complex surgical interventions during the ﬁrst year of life. Identifying modiﬁable factors that affect growth may result in improved outcomes. The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) completed a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in ISV physiology.10 The primary outcome measure for this clinical trial was weight-for-age z-score at 14 months of age. Although no growth beneﬁt was seen in infants treated with enalapril, clinical and growth data were collected systematically and prospectively in this large study. The purposes of this analysis were to use this well-characterized cohort of ISV physiology to describe growth patterns in the ﬁrst 14 months of life and to determine the inﬂuence of patientrelated factors, feeding regimen, and medical factors on growth. Methods Details of the ISV Trial study design and main results have been published.10,11 In brief, ISV physiology between 1 week and 45 days of age with stable systemic and pulmonary blood ﬂow in whom an SCPC (bidirectional Glenn anastamosis, From the Department of Pediatrics (R.W.), and Department of Surgery (L.L.), University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT; New England Research Institutes, Watertown, MA (V.Z.); Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA (C.R., B.M-C.); Department of Pediatrics, Children’s Hospital of New York, New York, NY (K.A., D.H.); Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH (J.A.); Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC (A.A.); Department of Cardiology, Children’s Hospital Boston, Boston, MA (C.D-M., R.M.); Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI (N.G.); Department of Pediatrics, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC (K.L.); School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (B.M-C.); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD (V.P., M.S.); and Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (J.R.) *List of investigators of the Pediatric Heart Network is available at www.jpeds.com (Appendix).

Exclusion criteria included gestational age <35 weeks, small for gestational age (<10th percentile), a recognizable chromosomal or phenotypic syndromes associated with growth failure, hemodynamic instability, or other contraindication to angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors. Subjects were enrolled at 10 centers in North America between August 2003 and May 2007. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review or ethics board at each participating institution, and written informed consent was obtained from a parent/guardian. This clinical trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00113087). Data collected at the time of study enrollment included a detailed anatomic diagnosis, age at study enrollment, gestational age, birth weight, sex, race, and ethnicity. Socioeconomic status (annual household income and highest grade of school completed by parent/guardian) was collected at the 14-month visit. Anthropometric measurements (weight and height) were made at 7 points: study enrollment, 4 days after study enrollment, 2 weeks after enrollment, pre-SCPC, 7 days after restarting study drug after SCPC, age 10 months, and age 14 months.11 All study coordinators performing anthropometric measurements at PHN centers underwent training speciﬁcally designed to ensure accurate and reliable measurements of weight and height by using training modules from the Health Resources and Service Administration Maternal and Child Health Bureau (http://dept.washington. edu/growth/). All anthropometric measurements included in the analysis (study enrollment, pre-SCPC, and 14 months) were performed at PHN centers. Quality assurance measures included using dedicated, appropriately calibrated scales, duplicate measurements, and third measurements when the ﬁrst two were not in agreement (within 0.1 kg for weight, within 1.0 cm for height). Nutritional data collected at these points included method of feeding (tube, breast, bottle) and total daily caloric intake. Daily caloric intake was determined on the basis of caloric density of formula or breast milk (fortiﬁed or non-fortiﬁed [assumed 20 kcal/oz], given via feeding tube or bottle) and the estimated volume consumed on the day before the study visit as reported by the caregiver. Method of feeding was deﬁned as: patients with any type of tube feeding (nasojejunal, nasogastric, gastrostomy) were classiﬁed as tube fed; patients with any breastfeeding (actual breastfeeding rather than receiving breast milk via a feeding tube or bottle) were classiﬁed as breast fed, and all other patients were classiﬁed as bottle fed. Total calories per day were also collected at the time of discharge after neonatal hospitalization. Medical and surgical data were collected from the neonatal and SCPC hospitalizations. Data collected included type of surgery, number of concurrent surgical procedures, length of ventilator support, length of intensive care unit stay, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications (arrhythmia, chylothorax, prolonged chest tube drainage, and pacemaker placement), number of discharge medications, and discharge oxygen saturation. All echocardiograms were analyzed at a single core laboratory.12 Statistical Analysis Two distinct physiologic states are present in ISV physiology during the ﬁrst 14 months of life: before the SCPC when the volume-loaded single ventricle provides both the systemic and pulmonary blood ﬂow, and after the SCPC when the single ventricle provides the systemic blood ﬂow only. Comparison of the weight and height z-scores at enrollment and pre-SCPC and pre-SCPC and at 14 months was performed with paired t tests. The outcome variables assessed were change in weight-for-age z-scores: (1) pre-SCPC minus study enrollment (period 1); and (2) ﬁnal study visit at 14 months of age minus pre-SCPC (period 2). The choice of the outcomes was informed by analyzing Lowess non-parametric curves. All z-scores were calculated by using World Health Organization standards. Because there were no differences in weight or height between the treatment groups in the ISV Trial, growth data for both treatment groups, enalapril and placebo, were combined for this analysis. Data are described as frequencies, medians with 25th and 75th percentile values, and means with SDs as appropriate. Normalizing transformation was performed for skewed variables. Because weight and height were strongly collinear, only weight was used for regression analysis. The study population used for analysis was restricted to those subjects with non-missing weight-for-age z-scores. Subjects with missing weight were compared with subjects with non-missing weight. Univariate associations between the outcome and each of the potential predictors were investigated ﬁrst. Multivariable linear regression analysis of each testing dataset was performed initially with all testing variables included, to determine overall adjusted R2 for the number of included variables. Stepwise multivariable regression was performed for the outcome, with further testing for non-linear associations. Variable selection for ﬁnal models was guided by bootstrap bagging (1000 random sample datasets) to assess reliability (percentage of random sample datasets for which the variable was selected) for inclusion. Interactions with the predictors were not assessed. Data analyses were performed with SAS statistical software version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Results The clinical characteristics of the 230 subjects enrolled in the ISV Trial are shown in Table I (available at www.jpeds.com). Mean age at trial enrollment was 20.4  9.0 days, and 63% of subjects had a diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Of the 230 subjects, 28 were withdrawn from the study before the pre-SCPC visit, and two did not have a pre-SCPC visit. Reasons for withdrawal included death in 15 subjects, transplant in two subjects, family choice in 8 subjects, physician choice in one subject, loss to follow-up in one subject, and other reason in one subject. Of the remaining 200 subjects, 197 had an available weight at the pre-SCPC THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS  www.jpeds.com Vol. 159, No. 6 1018 Williams et al

visit and formed the cohort for analysis of period 1. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between the 197 patients with an available weight at the pre-SCPC visit and the 33 patients without an available weight. Of the 202 subjects not withdrawn from the study before the pre-SCPC visit, 17 were withdrawn from the study before the ﬁnal 14-month visit. Reasons for withdrawal included death in 8 subjects, transplant in 5 subjects, family choice in one subject, physician choice in one subject, loss to follow-up in one subject, and other reason in one subject. All the remaining 185 subjects had weight measurements at the ﬁnal 14-month visit, and 183 subjects had an available weight measurement at the pre-SCPC visit. There were 173 subjects who underwent an SCPC. The remaining 10 subjects underwent palliative procedures physiologically different from an SCPC and were excluded from the analysis (Kawashima procedure in 5, systemic to pulmonary artery shunt in 3, and no further palliation in 2). The 173 subjects undergoing an SCPC with an available weight measurement at the ﬁnal study visit formed the cohort for period 2. Of these subjects, 130 were included in the ﬁnal regression model. Patients not included had missing values for one of the key candidate predictors, caloric intake. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between subjects included in the model and those not included. Values for weight and height at birth and for all 7 study points are shown in Table II (available at www.jpeds.com). The percentage of patients with weight-for-age z-score <2 was 26% at the time of study enrollment, 36% pre-SCPC, and 11% at 14 months. The pattern of growth z-scores for weight and height on the basis of data available for each of the seven points is shown graphically in Figure 1 (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing Lowess curves). Average weight-for-age z-score decreased by one SD from birth to study enrollment at 20  9 days from 0.15  1.06 to 1.27  1.27. There was also a decrease in weight-for-age z-score from study enrollment to the 2-week visit, with no signiﬁcant further decline in weight-for-age z-score between the 2-week visit and pre-SCPC visit. At the time of the 2-week visit 81 of 219 patients (37%) were still hospitalized. Mean weight-for-age z-scores increased after the SCPC. The weight- and height-for-age z-scores were closely associated, with Pearson correlation coefﬁcients of 0.78 at baseline, 0.69 at pre-SCPC, and 0.70 at 14 months (P < .001 for all associations). Figure 2 demonstrates the z-scores for weight and height at baseline, pre-SCPC, and at 14 months of age. Weightfor-age and height-for-age z-scores decreased signiﬁcantly from baseline to pre-SCPC, and then increased signiﬁcantly from pre-SCPC to 14 months of age (P < .01 for each paired comparison). The mean change in weight-for-age z-score for period 1 was 0.37  1.15 (n = 197), and the mean change for period 2 was 1.12  0.89 (n = 173). The change in weight and height growth for each of the two periods were signiﬁcantly associated (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient 0.49 for period 1 and 0.47 for period 2, P < .001 for each). Period 1: Study Enrollment to Pre-SCPC The results of univariate analysis of the relationship of predictor variables to the change in weight-for-age z-score for time period 1 are shown in Table III. Weight-for-age z-score at the beginning of this period (study enrollment) was negatively associated with the change in weight-for-age z-score (R = 0.57, P < .01). Although a number of variables were associated with the outcome in univariate analysis, in the multivariable model (Table III), only age at study enrollment, gestational age, method of feeding, and clinical center remained signiﬁcant (adjusted R2 = 0.39, P < .001). The change in weight-for-age z-score was less negative (better growth) in subjects who were older at the time of enrollment, born at lower gestational age, and who received nutrition via breastfeeding or bottle-feeding rather than tube-feeding. There was no difference in age at enrollment among clinical centers. Period 2: Pre-SCPC to Final Study Visit at 14 Months of Age The results of univariate analysis of the relationship of predictor variables to the change in weight-for-age z-score for period 2 are shown in Table IV. Weight-for-age z-score at the beginning of this period (pre-SCPC) was negatively associated with the change in weight-for-age z-score (R = 0.43, P < .01). In the ﬁnal multivariable model (Table IV), only 2 predictor variables were selected with Figure 1. A, Lowess-smoothed curve and scatterplot of weight-for-age z-score versus age in months.

stepwise regression: age at SCPC and daily caloric intake per kilogram of body weight at the pre-SCPC visit (R2 = 0.10, P = .002). The increase in weight-for-age z-score was greater (better growth) in subjects undergoing the SCPC at an earlier age and in subjects receiving more calories per kilogram of body weight at the time of the pre-SCPC visit. Discussion Growth failure is common in infants with congenital heart disease, including those with single ventricle physiology.5,6,8,9,13 There are likely multiple mechanisms contributing to growth failure in this population, including chronic cyanosis, alterations in energy expenditure,14,15 inadequate caloric intake,16,17 genetic factors,18 and alterations in serum growth factors and growth hormone.19 It can be difﬁcult to achieve adequate nutrition in neonates with single ventricle physiology who typically undergo complex surgical palliation within the ﬁrst few days to weeks of life, with further surgical palliation within the ﬁrst year of life. Optimizing nutritional status has been targeted as a key component in improving interstage outcome in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome in the Joint Council on Congenital Heart Disease Quality Improvement Task Force’s quality improvement collaborative.20 In our cohort, the most dramatic change in weight-for-age z-score was from study enrollment (average age, 3 weeks) to the 2-week visit, with a decrease in the mean z-score of 0.36 during this period. From the 2-week visit to the pre-SCPC visit, there was no change in mean weight-for-age z-score, suggesting growth velocity stabilized during this period. Growth during this interstage period is important because poor growth and nutrition during early infancy may adversely affect neurodevelopment21 and surgical outcome after the SCPC.7 At the 2-week post-enrollment study visit, approximately one-third of patients were still hospitalized, indicating a potential opportunity for intensive nutritional intervention. Earlier single center, retrospective studies have investigated the predictors of poor weight gain in ISV physiology before the SCPC. In a study of 50 infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kelleher et al found that a lower weight-for-age z-score at the time of SCPC was associated with fewer calories/ounce of enteral feeds at the time of neonatal hospital discharge, worse right ventricular function, more frequent hospital re-admissions, and higher oxygen saturations at the time of neonatal hospital discharge.5 Anderson et al13 found that subjects with a lower weight-for-age z-score at neonatal hospital discharge and non-Caucasian race had a lower weight-for-age z-score at the time of the SCPC and that lower average daily weight gain from neonatal discharge to SCPC was associated with formula feeding at neonatal discharge, a higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and higher systemic oxygen saturation. In both of these studies, the absolute weight-for-age z-score was the outcome variable rather than the change in weight-for-age z-score used in our study. In our multicenter study, multivariable modeling demonstrated that there was less of a decrease in weight-for-age z-score before the SCPC in those patients who were of younger gestational age, older at the time of study enrollment, and receiving nutrition via breastfeeding or bottlefeeding rather than tube-feeding. The clinical center also was signiﬁcant in the multivariable analysis. The greatest decline in weightfor-age z-score is seen early during the neonatal period, likely explaining the ﬁrst two ﬁndings. Those patients who were older at the time of enrollment likely had a decrease in weight-for-age z-score before study enrollment, therefore less of a change than those enrolled earlier, and those of younger gestational age were also likely smaller with less potential for decline in weight-for-age z-score. Growth failure was less prominent in breast- or bottle-fed infants, suggesting that they may have been healthier than the tube-fed infants. Supplementation with tube feeds did not mitigate growth failure, suggesting either increased metabolic demand in this subset of patients, inadequate net caloric intake, perhaps caused by inadequate adjustment of feeding volume during follow-up, or a combination of both. Approaches to nutritional support in this population vary in clinical centers, and our ﬁndings suggest that feeding and nutritional practices at some centers may result in better weight gain. Careful nutritional evaluation with a detailed history of caloric intake and appropriate adjustments in feeding, particularly in infants receiving supplemental nutrition via tube-feeding, may result in improved growth in these patients. A diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, ventricular dysfunction, and severity of atrioventricular valve regurgitation were not associated with the change in z-score before the SCPC in multivariable analysis.

After the SCPC, there was a gradual increase in the mean weight-for-age z-score with a mean improvement of >1 SD in our cohort at 14 months of age. A greater increase in weight-for-age z-score was seen in those patients who were receiving a higher daily caloric intake per kilogram of body weight at the time of the pre-SCPC visit and patients who underwent SCPC at a younger age, although this model explained onlyapproximately10%ofthevarianceinchangeinz-scorefor this period. A likely explanation for the low variance explained with this model is that the favorable change in hemodynamics that occurs with the decrease in volume load on the single ventricle overwhelms most other factors. We found a fairly strong negative association between the weight pre-SCPC and the increase in weight-for-age z-score, suggesting those patients with the worst growth may beneﬁt most from an earlier SCPC.

Higher average daily caloric intake per kilogram of body weight pre-SCPC was also an important predictor of improved weight gain after the SCPC. This ﬁnding highlights the importance of maintaining nutritional support in these patients after hospital discharge and throughout infancy. On average, the weight-for-age z-scores were much closer to the population mean at the 14-month visit (mean z-score, 0.5); however, a signiﬁcant subset of patients remained at risk for poor growth. This study has some important limitations. Only patients who fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria, speciﬁcally those ISV physiology with stable systemic and pulmonary blood ﬂow who were doing relatively well at less than 45 days of age, were approached for enrollment. Sicker, less stable patients who may be at the highest risk for growth failure were not included in thisstudy. In addition,infantswith agestationalage<35weeks and infants who were small for gestational age were excluded. Patients with recognizable genetic syndromes associated with growth failure were excluded from the ISV Trial; therefore, the inﬂuence of genetic syndromes on growth in ISV physiology could not be assessed. The greatest decline in weight-for-age z-score for the study population was from birth to 2 weeks after study enrollment; however, because the birth weight wasnotobtainedaccordingtoourstandardprotocol,wechose to use the change in weight-for-age z-score from study enrollment to pre-SCPC for analysis. Additionally, only 130 of the 173 subjects who completed the trial had complete data and were included in the ﬁnal regression model. Aggressive nutritional support and performance of the SCPC at a younger age are modiﬁable factors associated with a favorable change in weight-for-age z-score during the ﬁrst 14 months of life in this patient population. n Submitted for publication Jan 7, 2011; last revision received Apr 1, 2011; accepted May 26, 2011.
