Limitations for performing adequate studies of the pediatric population include the many associated conditions that fragment the classification of pediatric PH, the relatively small numbers of PAH patients at each center, the scarcity of multidisciplinary pediatric PAH programs, the lack of a national PH network, and suboptimal communication between scientists and clinicians.3 There is clearly a need to better define the natural history and course of pediatric PAH, to develop new strategies to identify patients at risk for the development of PAH, and to establish novel approaches to diagnose, to monitor the disease progression of, and to treat children with PAH.4 Pediatric PH is distinct from adult PH in several ways."}

The timing of pulmonary vascular injury is a critical determinant of the subsequent response of the developing lung to such adverse stimuli, including hyperoxia, hypoxia, hemodynamic stress, and inflammation.

Thus, a normal pulmonary vascular bed is required for maintenance of lung structure, metabolism, and gas exchange and confers the ability to tolerate increased workloads imposed by exercise.

In addition, perinatal factors may contribute to an increased risk for the late development of PH in adulthood, leading to the speculation that an important window may exist for early identification of susceptibility factors or interventions.

The purpose of this document is to provide a general overview of PVD in neonates, infants, and children and recommendations for the assessment and treatment of children with PH. As noted, many gaps remain in our knowledge of the developing lung circulation and its response to injury, unique features of PH in children, and optimal clinical evaluations and treatment strategies."}

Primary Biventricular Repair In primary biventricular repair, the AV valves are reconstructed so that nearly similarsized AV valves are produced and the ASD is closed. The VSD is closed with a patch to create nearly equal-sized ventricles; the patch is relocated to the right in RV-dominant AVSDs and to the left in the LV-dominant AVSDs.

The mortality rates ranged between 10.4% and 18% [117–119]. Survival at long-term was excellent and varied between 88% and 90% [117,118,120].

The mortality after conversion from SV to TV is low (1–11%) [117,121] However, operative and catheter re-interventions were needed during follow-up in 19% and 38% patients respectively [121]. While the initial LV Z-scores before Stage I SV palliation were similar, the Z-scores of the LV increased signiﬁcantly in the SV to TV conversion group and the Z scores decreased in the SV palliation group who have not had SV to TV conversion [122]."}

Improvement of LV end-diastolic volume by echo from 28.1 to 58.5 mL/m2 was also demonstrated in a limited number of the unbalanced AVSD patients after SV to TV conversion [123]. 7.6. Comparison of Various Methods of Intervention When mid-term results of primary, staged biventricular repair, and SV to TV conversion of unbalanced complete AVSDs were examined, there was low morbidity and mortality, but surgical and/or catheter re-interventions were required in 52% of patients [124]."}

SV to TV conversion and biventricular recruitment appear to be a vital option for children with Down syndrome and heterotaxy syndrome because of anatomic and physiologic reasons. Babies with Down syndrome tolerate SV physiology poorly [115]. Children with heterotaxy syndrome have intricate and abnormal AV valve anatomy and require complicated and innovative repair methods. These patients tolerate AV valve insufﬁciency poorly when SV palliation is opted for."}

Hybrid Approach for HLHS In HLHS patients with high risk for Norwood surgery, particularly in premature babies, a hybrid approach has been utilized. In the ﬁrst stage of this procedure, banding of both branch pulmonary arteries through median sternotomy and stent implantation into the ductus arteriosus via pulmonary arteriotomy (Figures 30 and 31), originally described by Akintuerk and associates [126], are performed simultaneously [126–129].

Summary and Conclusions Several cardiac defects have functionally single ventricle; notable of these are: hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia, single ventricle (DILV), unbalanced AV septal defect, mitral atresia, and others. Single ventricle physiology is dissimilar from that of biventricular physiology and a fragile balance of the blood ﬂows between the pulmonary and systemic circulations should be preserved."}
{"text": "agile balance of the blood ﬂows between the pulmonary and systemic circulations should be preserved. These babies are generally managed by staged total cavo-pulmonary connection (Fontan) in three stages. The prevalence of inter-stage mortality is high (5–15%). It is more frequent between Stages I and II than between Stages II and III. The inter-stage mortality is largely associated with: restrictive atrial communication, obstruction of the aortic arch, distortion/stenosis of the pulmonary arteries, AV valve insufﬁciency, shunt blockage, and inter-current illnesses."}

Inherent to parallel circulation are critical relationships between oxygen consumption, pulmonary blood flow, systemic blood flow, partially oxygenated arterial blood (Sao2), systemic venous saturation, and pulmonary venous saturation. Sao2 depends on the balance between systemic and pulmonary flow, lung health, and systemic venous saturation."}
{"text": "nds on the balance between systemic and pulmonary flow, lung health, and systemic venous saturation. The most life-threatening risk associated with shunt-dependent SVHD, particularly with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or ductus arteriosus stent, is an abrupt reduction in pulmonary blood flow, thus highlighting the importance of monitoring Sao2 trend during the interstage period. A more gradual reduction in pulmonary blood flow or pulmonary venous desaturation will also lead to a fall in Sao2."}
{"text": "reduction in pulmonary blood flow or pulmonary venous desaturation will also lead to a fall in Sao2. This reduction in Sao2 is dependent on an ability to increase systemic blood flow to maintain tissue oxygen delivery. Inability to augment systemic blood flow will result in lower systemic venous saturation and further reduce Sao2. The inefficiency of parallel circulation combined with cyanosis, limited myocardial reserve, and autonomic responses to stress, places the infant with shunt-dependent circulation at risk for critical impairment of oxygen delivery."}
{"text": "aces the infant with shunt-dependent circulation at risk for critical impairment of oxygen delivery. Multiple cardiac and noncardiac causes have been implicated in interstage death. Most common are residual or recurrent lesions and development of intercurrent childhood illness. Restrictive atrial communication, arch obstruction, obstructed shunt flow, pulmonary artery distortion, atrioventricular valve insufficiency, and arrhythmias have each been associated with interstage mortality (Figure 1).1,4,6,7 Of the Figure 1."}

IHM may be only one component, particularly because IHM use is concomitant with improved discharge processes, care coordination, and nutrition bundles, which are all linked to better outcomes.3 Additional understanding of key drivers of improvement can allow resources to be targeted more effectively. It is unlikely a randomized trial will be performed because of the wide acceptance of the benefits of IHM."}
{"text": "unlikely a randomized trial will be performed because of the wide acceptance of the benefits of IHM. Rather, further research exploring the use of novel statistical techniques can assist in predicting which infants with a single ventricle are most at risk for sudden death, inform future interstage care, and define who may benefit from remaining inpatient interstage.9,18 Use of multilanguage, low literacy, affordable telehealth and social media options for monitoring and communicating with families requires further investigation."}

SUMMARY Infants with shunt-dependent SVHD pose unique challenges during the interstage period for caregivers and the healthcare team related to potential sudden acute hemodynamic decompensation, hypoxia, feeding difficulties, and somatic growth failure. IHM is an innovative strategy developed to augment conventional outpatient management and to assist with early detection of physiologic changes associated with morbidity and mortality following successful S1P."}

There is overwhelming evidence of improvement in single ventricle infant survival and growth outcomes with IHM programs.
