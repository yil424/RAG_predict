  "key_reasons": [
    "Tachycardia (HR 143.1 bpm) despite being on ECMO, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction or increased oxygen demand.",
    "Hypoxemia (O2_sat 78.5%) and decreased NIRS (69.4%) suggesting inadequate oxygenation and perfusion to tissues.",

  ],
  "suggested_actions": [
    "Review ECMO circuit and blood gas management to optimize oxygen delivery and ventilation.",
    "Consider increasing FiO2 or adjusting ECMO flow rates to improve oxygenation and perfusion.",
    "Monitor for signs of cardiac dysfunction, including echocardiogram and serial lactate levels, and consider consulting cardiology team if necessary."
