# LLM Decision
- risk_level: **medium**
- trigger_alarm_now: **False**
- key_reasons:
  - Tachycardia (HR 143.1 bpm) despite being on ECMO, which may indicate cardiac dysfunction or increased oxygen demand.
  - Hypoxemia (O2_sat 78.5%) and decreased NIRS (69.4%) suggesting inadequate oxygenation and perfusion to tissues.
  - Elevated lactate levels (1.96 mmol/L) indicating ongoing anaerobic metabolism.
- suggested_actions:
  - Review ECMO circuit and blood gas management to optimize oxygen delivery and ventilation.
  - Consider increasing FiO2 or adjusting ECMO flow rates to improve oxygenation and perfusion.
  - Monitor for signs of cardiac dysfunction, including echocardiogram and serial lactate levels, and consider consulting cardiology team if necessary.

Figure 1 and the key recommendations below provide a summary of the recommendations for patients supported on ECMO and for specific high-risk groups. Limitations and barriers to implement the above recommendations may include resource constraints and training required for successful implementation.
